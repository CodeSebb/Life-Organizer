# My Life Tracker <br>

Your life is complicated, intricate, and multi-faceted. This app aims to simplify life just a bit more for you.
Utilizing React-Native, API's, and a bit of TypeScript along the way, this soon-to-be mobile app will organize 5 key categories of your
life and centralize them under one app. <br>

<h2>🛠Tools</h2><br>
An app with this many moving parts and variety of features and components needs to be wireframed. For those new to engineering,<br>
wireframing is where you create previews of interactive features of your product(project) which helps create structure. This structure <br>
allows the creation process of the application to be less cluttered with a mess of different ideas and more clearly defines the requirements, <br>
checkpoints, and needs of the project. <br>

<br>
For this project, I've decided to utilize Figma as my wireframing and design tool. Figma is an incredibly versatile tool that can be utilized <br> 
in creating beautiful UI/UX templates for your website(Hire me, Figma). <br> 
Here, I created a basic flow chart of the specific features within the website(I will be breaking down more of each category as the project progresses):<br>

<h2>📑Tabs</h2> <br>
<img src="github_images/BottomNavBar.png">
There are 5 tabs that signify a different aspect of your life:
<ul> 
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Pet</li>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Partner</li>
  <li>Family & Friends</li>
</ul> <br>

<h2>📃Work</h2> <br>
Our favorite thing in the entire world, work has many things that come along with it that need to be kept track of. Utilizing a Gantt chart feature to track specific projects happening at work, a leave balance bank(which will calculate your hours of leave using a formula) which can track how much you accrue during the weeks and months working, and a link to any storage system you prefer to store important documents (emails of praise from managers, clients satisfaction surveys, quarterly metric reports where you rocked it), this feature is meant to be a quick and easy section that provides brief summaries of work information that is easily digestible.<br>

<h2>🐕Pet</h2> <br>
Let's be honest here: our pets are our real favorites. Whether your pet doge, cat, parrot, mosquito, or Nemo's second cousin twice removed on his dad's side, there's so much joy that these beautiful parts of our lives bring us. To make sure we keep getting those needed puppy cuddles, we need an appointment tracker, a way of managing their inventory of food, treats, and toys, along with a folder that contains their specific documents, important records, and photos. Because there is no such thing as having too many pictures of your pet on your devices and anyone else who says otherwise is lying. <br>

<h2>🙋🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♀️You(Home)</h2><br>
Yes, YOU! In order to have all the other categories, there first needs to be the foundational piece, which is you. With a built-in finance tracker, learning/habit builder, and self-care tracker. Each of these, along with their details will be shared soon. <br>

<h2>❤Partner</h2><br>
The wind beneath your wings, the Zendaya to your Tom Holland, the peanut butter to your marrionberry jelly(trust me on this one), your other half is an important person in your life. It's easy to lose track of simple facts or dates, so this section is meant to minimize how often you forget your partners' birthday(can't relate). Keep track of special trips coming up together, including the finances for that trip and the daily agenda's, have fun together with a special random date generator that is meant to challenge each other to create new memories together, and keep track of a profile of this person with important information such as allergies, where you two shared your first date together, and what their idea of a perfect date would be(spoiler, it's April 25th).<br>

<h2>🙌🏽Family + Friends</h2><br>
"Nothing like watching your family(and friends) fight, I always say" - Rick Riordan <em>The Lightning Thief</em>. Keeping track of important dates and events is critical to ensure that your loved ones feel the love. From profile trackers for your family and friends, to a schedule to manage each specific event, this section is all about the love and leaves the stress behind.
