# My Life Tracker <br>

People's lives are complicated, intricate, and multi-faceted. This app aims to simplify life just a bit more for you.
Utilizing React-Native, API's, and a bit of TypeScript along the way, this soon-to-be mobile app will organize 5 key categories of your
life and centralize them under one app. <br>

<h2>Tools</h2><br>
An app with this many moving parts and variety of features and components needs to be wireframed. For those new to engineering,<br>
wireframing is where you create previews of interactive features of your product(project) which helps create structure. This structure <br>
allows the creation process of the application to be less cluttered with a mess of different ideas and more clearly defines the requirements, <br>
checkpoints, and needs of the project. <br>

For this project, I've decided to utilize Figma as my wireframing and design tool. Figma is an incredibly versatile tool that can be utilized <br> 
in creating beautiful UI/UX templates for your website(Hire me, Figma). <br> 
Here, I created a basic flow chart of the specific features within the website(I will be breaking down more of each category as the project progresses):<br>

<h2>Tabs</h2> <br>

There are 5 tabs that signify a different aspect of your life:
<ul> 
  <li>You</li>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Relationship/Partner</li>
  <li>Friends/Family</li>
  <li>Pet</li>
</ul> <br>

<h2>You(Home)</h2><br>
Yes, YOU! In order to have all the other categories, there first needs to be the foundational piece, which is you. With a built-in finance tracker, learning/habit builder, and self-care tracker. Each of these, along with their details will be shared soon.
