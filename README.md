# My Life Tracker <br>

People's lives are complicated, intricate, and multi-faceted. This app aims to simplify life just a bit more for you.
Utilizing React-Native, API's, and a bit of TypeScript along the way, this soon-to-be mobile app will organize 5 key categories of your
life and centralize them under one app. <br>

<h2>Tabs</h2> <br>
There are 5 tabs that signify a different aspect of your life:
<ul> 
  <li>You</li>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Relationship/Partner</li>
  <li>Friends/Family</li>
  <li>Pet</li>
</ul> <br>
